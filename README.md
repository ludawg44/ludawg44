### Hello there 👋🏽

I'm a data analyst based in Ridgefield, Connecticut. A fellow University of California, Santa Cruz slug, I majored in Business Management Economics. I'm keen on any conversations that involve people analytics, AWS, and data engineering. In my spare time you'll find me outside at a park with my three children.
